How did viewing a diff between two versions help you spot the bug?
It reduces the contents which needs to be looked through.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It allows more efficient troubleshooting and gives us access to exact details of change for each version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: Each commit could be logically separated. Avoid saving versions that are incomplete
Cons: Prone to human error (forgetfulness)

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is more for programming related files where they could be related to each other. Google docs is more for other general files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Use git log command to view the history of commits and commit IDs. Use git diff command to find out the difference between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It allows us to revert back to previous working version easily.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
For creating my own version control repository.
