When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Whenever possible. Especially when working on a public project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that programmer is aware of what has been changed.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is creating clone on Github. Clone is for cloning a copy local repo from Github or locally. Branch is for branching on the same repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The system will be able to tell what has since been updated at the next push/pull.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Constant communication would be necessary. GitHub enables easier version control especially in a large working group.
